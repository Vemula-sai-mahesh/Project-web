    Piezo for rural electrification. Solar energy, Wind energy and Piezo treated as non-renewable source of 
    energy.</pre>
                <pre>                   The major disadvantages of using independent renewable energy resources are the unavailability
    of power for all time. For overcoming these issues, we can use solar, wind, and piezoelectric energy 
    sources together. So that any one source of power fails others will take care of the generation. The hybrid
    energy system is the combination of two or more energy sources for generating power and delivering to 
    the load. In other words, it can be defined as the energy system which is designed toextract power by using
    two or more energy sources.</pre>
    <h4 id="introsub"><u>HYBRID POWER GENERATION:</u></h4>
    <p>Hybrid power generation is a term used to describe the use of multiple sources of energy to 
        generate electricity. The idea behind hybrid power generation is to combine different renewable 
        energy sources, such as solar, wind, and piezo, to create a more reliable and efficient system.</p>

                <pre>                   The main objective of our project is design and fabricate a Hybrid Power Generation 
    model using Solar Panel, Wind Turbine and Piezo.</pre>
    <h4 id="introsub"><u>Secondary Objectives:</u></h4>

                    Besides the main objective, following are our secondary objectives:
                    To understand project planning and execution. 
                    To understand the fabrication techniques in mechanical workshop and various machine tools. 
                    To make day to day human life easier by proper use of technology.

                <p>The project aims at developing a system which makes use of Piezo, Wind and Solar energy for rural 
                    electrification. Piezo, Wind and Solar energy is treated as non-renewable sources of energy. Solar 
                    panels generate electricity using the same principles of electronics as chemical batteries or standard 
                    electrical outlets. With solar panels, it's all about the free flow of electrons through a circuit. A wind 
                    turbine is a device that converts kinetic energy from the wind, also called wind energy, 
                    into mechanical energy; a process known as wind power and that mechanical energy is used to 
                    produce electricity, the device may be called a wind turbine or wind power plant. The power in the 
                    Piezo can be computed by using the concepts of kinetics. It works on the principle of converting 
                    pressure energy of Piezo blade set to electrical energy.</p>
                    <p>
                        By incorporating these three energy sources together we can develop a reliable hybrid energy system 
where during abnormal conditions at least one source stays active and during normal condition all 
three can act together. This system consists of Solar panel, Wind turbine, Piezo electric sensors to 
suitably convert the individual energy from each into electrical energy. The energy from the three 
sources is hybridized to charge a battery in a faster way. The DC supply from the battery is then 
converted into AC supply with suitable circuits and can be applied to AC appliances. This system can 
be very useful for rural electrification.

            <p>The efficiency of solar panels has improved dramatically in recent years, from an average of around 15% conversion of sunlight to usable energy to around 20%.
                 High-efficiency solar panels can reach as much as nearly 23%. The power rating of a standard-sized panel has likewise increased from 250W to 370W.

                    <p>Solar radiation is light – also known as electromagnetic radiation – that is emitted by the sun. While every location on Earth 
                        receives some sunlight over a year, the amount of solar radiation that reaches any one spot on the Earth’s surface varies. 
                        Solar technologies capture this radiation and turn it into useful forms of energy.</p><br>
                    <p>There are two main types of solar energy technologies—photovoltaics (PV) and concentrating solar-thermal power (CSP). </p>

                    <h3>PHOTOVOLTAICS:</h3>
                    <p>Standard photovoltaic solar panels are the most efficient application of photovoltaics. However, 
                        photovoltaic glass allows generation from surfaces like building windows that were previously incapable of anything but passive solar energy 
                        and also enables other options, like color choices. Other technologies include low-tech solar heaters created 
                        from recycled cans that provide an inexpensive source of heat.</p> <br>
                    <h3>CONCENTRATED SOLAR POWER:</h3>
                    <p>Concentrated solar power uses multiple lenses or reflectors to collect more of the sun’s thermal energy. 
                        Thermal energy collected through the day is typically applied to oil or molten salts that retain heat to boil water for steam turbine 
                        generators throughout the night.</p>
                    <h3>SOLAR CELL:</h3>
                    <p>A solar cell, or photovoltaic cell is a form of photoelectric cell,
                         defined as a device whose electrical characteristics, such as current, voltage, or resistance, vary when 
                         exposed to light. Individual solar cell devices are often the electrical building blocks of photovoltaic modules, 
                         known colloquially as solar panels. The common single junction silicon solar cell can produce a maximum open-circuit voltage of 
                         approximately 0.5 to 0.6 volts. Some of them are:</p>

                       <U>SOLAR ENERGY - ELECTRICITY GENERATION</U>:</h2>
                    <h3>Step 1: Solar Panels Capture Solar Energy:</h3>
                    <p>When sunlight hits the thin layer of semiconductive material,
                         it triggers the release of electrons from silicon atoms. 
                         The negatively charged electrons are then attracted to the positively charged side of the cell. 
                         This “photovoltaic effect” forms as a result of the free-flowing electrons within the solar panel. 
                         The moving electrons create an electric current which is then harnessed
                         by the wiring connected to the solar panels to produce electricity.
                        </p>
                    <h3>Step 2: Solar Inverters Convert DC to AC:</h3>
                    <p>Solar panels produce electricity in the form of direct current (DC), 
                        which means the electricity only flows in one direction. However,
                         your home appliances use alternating current (AC) electricity,
                         which means the electricity flows in both directions.
                        </p>
                    <p>It’s a simple job, but an essential one if you want to take advantage of 
                        solar energy. Without the inverter, your system would create electricity,
                         but it wouldn’t be able to power anything.
                        </p>
                    <p>Solar inverters also allow you to connect your solar panel system to the internet 
                        so you can access information about your system’s performance. 
                        This helps you compare your solar energy production and your household energy consumption so you can check
                         if the system is functioning properly and meeting your electrical load as required.
                        </p>
                    <h3>Step 3: Electrical Panel Distributes Electricity:</h3>
                    <p>Your electrical panel distributes electricity throughout your home.
                     The circuit breakers in the electrical panel can also cut off the flow of current to
                      an electrical circuit in case a fault or surge occurs,
                         to prevent overload in electrical lines that can cause damage.
                        </p>
                    <p>While your solar panels generate electricity, they typically aren’t connected 
                        directly to your appliances or other electronic devices. In terms of 
                        understanding how do solar panels work, they provide electricity to the 
                        electrical panel, and your electrical panel separates that 
                        home solar power into individual circuits that 
                    </p>
                    
                </div>
                <div class="solara" id="solar4">
                    <p>run to everything in the house.</p>
                    <h3>Step 4: Electric Meter Records Consumption and Production:</h3>
                    <p>Your electric meter (sometimes called the “utility meter”) is the device your utility company 
                        uses to measure your electricity consumption. It’s how they know what to bill you each month.
                         A traditional electric meter has analog dials that spin as current flows through it, which is
                          why the utility company has someone check your meter in person once a month. 
                        Even then, that meter reading is just a summary of your electricity consumption for the month.
                    </p>
                    <p><b> Smart Meters and Net Metering</b> will record energy production in addition to consumption, 
                            and when you generate more energy than you need for your home, 
                            you can export that power to the grid and earn credits that can help reduce future electric bills.
                        </p>
                    <h3>Step 5: Batteries Store Excess Energy:

                    </h3>
                    <p>Installing solar battery storage is essential to maximizing the long-term 
                        benefits of going solar. If your solar panels generate more solar energy than you can use, 
                        you can store that extra electricity in a solar battery. That way, you have electricity available to you when the sun 
                        goes down or it’s a rainy day - instead of drawing from the electricity grid.
                    </p>
                    <p>Depending on the type, solar batteries can either store excess DC electricity that’s produced by your solar panels, or 
                        they can be charged by AC electricity that’s already been converted by your inverter.
                    </p>

                     Laws of physics described by Betz Limit says the maximum theoretical limit is 59.6%. The wind requires the rest of the energy

                      blades of a turbine cannot turn to produce electricity.</p>

                    <h2><u>WIND POWER GENERATION</u>:</h2>
                    <P>Wind power generation means the electrical energy by converting wind energy into rotating of the blades 
                        and converting that rotating energy into electrical energy by the generetor.</P>

                    <p>Wind turbines are one of the cheapest forms of making energy available to us, 
                        and they generate clean renewable energy, all from the power of the wind. 
                        Here’s everything you need to know about how wind turbines work.  </p>
                    
                </div>
                <div class="winda" id="wind2">
                    <h3><u> WORKING OF WIND POWER SYSTEM</u>:</h3>
                    <p>Wind farms are erected based on the availability of atmospheric pressure of wind in a specific region.
                         There are certain criteria’s and design procedure to erect wind mills as discussed in. At Highways there is 
                         availability of wind by the motion of moving vehicles. When a free moving air particle is disturbed by forceful 
                         object succeeding in its path a pressure is developed at the body of the object and it is delivered to the surrounding near objects.
                          By this phenomenon wind turbine is placed on the top of street light. The wind turbines are not placed in vertical path, but horizontally. 
                        </p>
                    <p>A wind turbine turns wind energy into electricity using the aerodynamic force from the rotor blades, 
                        which work like an airplane wing or helicopter rotor blade. When wind flows across the blade, 
                        the air pressure on one side of the blade decreases. The difference in air pressure across the two sides of the blade 
                        creates both lift and drag. The force of the lift is stronger than the drag and this causes the rotor to spin. 
                        The rotor connects to the generator, either directly (if it’s a direct drive turbine) or through a shaft and a series of gears 
                        (a gearbox) that speed up the rotation and allow for a physically smaller generator. This translation of aerodynamic 
                        force to rotation of a generator creates electricity.

                     <p id="wind2p">Wind turbines operate by transforming the kinetic energy in wind into mechanical power
                         which is used to generate electricity by spinning a generator. These turbines can be on land, or can be offshore wind turbines.
                        </p>
                        <p id="wind2p">A wind turbine consists of five major parts and many minor parts. The main components are the foundation, the tower, 
                            the rotor and hub (including three blades), the nacelle, and the generator.</p>

                    <h3>1. <u>Wind turbine foundation</u> :</h3>
                    <p>The foundation is in the ground for onshore turbines; it is invisible because it is covered with dirt. It is a large, 
                        heavy structural block of concrete that must support the entire turbine and the forces acting on. </p>
                    <p>In offshore turbines, the foundation is underwater and not visible. For offshore turbines far from the sea,
                         the base floats but has enough mass to support and sustain the weight of the turbine and any forces exerted on it.

                    <h3>2. <u>Wind energy tower</u>:</h3>
                    <p>The towers of most modern turbines are made of round steel tubes.
                         A rule of thumb for a turbine tower is that it is the same height as the circle’s diameter
                          its blades make as they spin. Generally, the taller the turbine,
                           the more susceptible to high-speed winds. Because the farther we are from the ground,
                            the stronger the wind (the wind does not have the same speed at different heights).
                        </p>
                    <h3>3. <u>Wind turbine rotor and hub</u> :</h3>
                    <p>The rotor is the rotating part of the turbine; it consists of three blades and a central part connecting the blades, the hub. </p>

                        <p>Although it is the most common, a turbine does not necessarily have three blades.
                             But the three-blade rotor has advantages such as optimum efficiency. 
                        The blades aren’t strong; they’re hollow and made of composite material that’s both lightweight and strong.
                         The trend is to make them bigger (for more power), 
                        lighter, and more robust. For aerodynamics, the blades are shaped like an airfoil (like an airplane’s wings).
                         Also, they are not flat and have a twist between their root and tip.
                         The blade can rotate up to 90° around its axis. This movement is called pitch.
                        
                        </p>
                        <p> The function of the hub is to hold the blades and allow them to rotate relative to the rest of the turbine body.</p>
                    <h3>4. <u>Wind turbine Nacelle</u> :</h3>
                    <p>The nacelle houses all the components that need to be on top of the turbine.</p>

                <div class="winda" id="wind4">
                    <p>The nacelle of a wind turbine is a complex electromechanical system with quite a few components that function correctly with precision. 
                        Significant turbine parts are the generator and the turbine
                        shaft that transfers the harvested power from wind to the generator through a gearbox. The gearbox is an essential part of the wind turbine; 
                        it’s on the cable car.</p>

                    <P>Piezoelectricity (also called the piezoelectric effect) is the appearance of an electrical potential

                        mechanical stress. Those materials include crystals, ceramics, polymers, wood (cellulose fibers), and a host of other synthetic 
                        and composite materials. Initially discovered in 1880 by the Curie brothers, the piezoelectric effect has

                    <p>A piezoelectric crystal is placed between two metal plates. At this point, the material is in 
                        perfect balance and does not conduct an electric current.
                    </p>
                    <p>Mechanical pressure is then applied to the material by the metal plates, which forces the electric 
                        charges within the crystal out of balance. </p>
                    <p>Excess negative and positive charges appear on opposite sides of the crystal face. The metal plate collects these charges,
                         which can be used to produce a voltage and send an electrical current through a circuit.</p>

                         The inverse piezoelectric effect converts electrical energy to mechanical energy.</p>
                    <p>Using the inverse piezoelectric effect can help develop devices that generate and produce acoustic sound waves.

                         The advantage of having such speakers is that they are very thin, which makes them useful in a range of phones.
                          Even medical ultrasound and sonar transducers use reverse piezoelectric effect.

                    <p>A hybrid energy system combines multiple types of energy generation and/or storage or uses two or more kinds
                        of fuel to power a generator. A hybrid energy system is a valuable method in the transition away from fossil 
                        fuelbased economies. Particularly in the short term, while new technologies to better integrate renewable energy
                        sources are still being developed, backing up renewable generation with conventional thermal electric production 
                        can actually help expand the use of renewable energy sources.</p>

                    <h2><u>HARDWARE COMPONENT DESCRIPTION </u>:</h2>
                        <p>This project is an exclusive project which is used to power electrical appliances by generating power using solar,
                             wind, and piezoelectric energy sources. The hybrid generated power is stored in a battery through a charging circuit.
                              The battery supply is then fed to an inverter circuit which converts DC supply to AC supply. This AC supply can be fed
                               to the electrical appliances. The block diagram of the project is shown in Figure 1 and different hardware components are
                                briefly explained in successive subsections.  </p>
                        <h3><u>A.	Solar Panel</u>:</h3>
                        <p>A typical solar panel comprises a glass substrate as a front side transparent protective member at a light-receiving side 
                            and back-side protective member. Ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA) films as sealing films arranged between the glass 
                            substrate and the backside protective member, and solar cells or silicon photovoltaic elements sealed by the EVA films. 
                            Solar panels have a large number of solar cells which are used to convert power from sunlight. </p>

                <div class="hybrida" id="hybrid4">
                    <p>The solar panel is connected to the charging circuit which gives the output of 12 volts/5watt and the
                        charging time of the solar panel is approximately 5 hours. The solar panels used in our project are shown in fig above.</p>
                    <h3><u>B.	Wind Turbine </u>:</h3>
                    <p>The wind is a renewable source of energy. A wind turbine connected to the shaft of the wind blades is used to convert the kinetic energy 
                        of the wind into electrical energy. The wind turbine is of two types depending upon the rotating axis of the blades. 
                        The first is a vertical axis wind turbine and the second one is horizontal axis wind turbine. In our project,
                         we have used a horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT) as shown in Figure 10. The HAWT has the main rotor shaft and electrical generator 
                         at the top of a tower and must be pointed to the direction of the wind. Small turbines are pointed by a simple wind vane,
                          while large turbines generally use a wind sensor coupled with a servo motor. Most have a wind turbine consists of a gearbox,
                           which turns the slow rotation of the blades into a quicker rotation. The output of the turbine depends on the speed of the wind. 
                           The power generated by the turbine is fluctuating. To obtain a continuous supply of power first the electricity is stored in a battery unit 
                           and then it is transferred to the load. </p>
                    <p>We simply used a 1000 rpm DC generator as a wind turbine whose shaft is suitably connected to the blades. 
                        The wind turbine is connected to the charging circuit which gives the output of 6volts /5wats and the charging time of the wind turbine 
                        is approximately 8 hours. </p>

                    <h3><u>C.  Piezoelectric Sensor Plate</u>:</h3>
                    <p>The harvesting of piezoelectric energy with the help of a piezoelectric generator is based upon the piezoelectric effect.
                         The piezoelectric generator principle states that the conversion chain starts from vibration for which a mechanical energy source 
                         is required. The vibrations are converted into electricity via the piezoelectric sensor element.
                          The electricity produced is then afterward formatted by a static converter before supplying to the load i.e. 
                          electrical device. </p>
                    <p>The piezo plate is connected to the charging circuit which gives the output of 2v and the charging time of the piezo plate is approximately 20 hours. A Piezoelectric sensor plate used in our project is shown in below fig. </p>

                    <h4>fig.no:12 Piezoelectric Sensor Plate.</h4>
                        <h3><u>D. Charging Circuit</u>:</h3>
                        <p>The piezo plate is connected to the charging circuit which gives the output of 2volts and the charging time of the piezo plate is approximately 20 hours. 
                            The output of the charging circuit is fed to the 12volts/1Amp battery.
                             Thus, the battery is charged simultaneously. </p>

                    <h3><u>E. Rechargeable Battery</u>:</h3>
                    <p>A rechargeable battery, storage battery, or accumulator is a type of electrical battery.
                         It comprises one or more electrochemical cells and is a type of energy accumulator. 
                         It is known as a secondary cell because its electrochemical reactions are electrically reversible.
                          Several different combinations of chemicals are commonly used including leadacid, Nickel Cadmium (NiCd), 
                          Nickel Metal hydride (NiMH), Lithium-Ion(Li-ion), and Lithium-Ion Polymer (Li-ion polymer). We have to choose battery 
                          bank size per the load requirement so that it should fulfill the requirement of load for calculating the battery bank size

            <P id="conclup">
                In this project, we used non-conventional energy sources such as solar, wind, and piezoelectric in a hybrid way to generate power.
                All three energy sources have their advantages, which are utilized here to supply power even in unwanted environmental conditions.
                Incorporating these three together developed a reliable hybrid energy system where during abnormal conditions at least one source
                stays active and during normal condition all three can act together. This system can be very useful for rural electrification.
